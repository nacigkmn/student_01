Spring Boot & React CRUD Application
This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using 
Java Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. 
It demonstrates the fundamental operations of a full-stack application 
by managing data in a relational database using REST APIs and React components.
